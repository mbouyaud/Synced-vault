J'adore cette initiative et aimerai la sortir du bois. Souvent nous avons discuté avec Jean Luc, d'utiliser plusieurs canaux, blog, post Medium, manifest, projet ... 
Comme le suggère Dave Snowden dans[ son dernier post](https://thecynefin.co/twelvetide-2201-setting-the-scene/), ne restons pas dans l'enlightment mais soyons acteur, pragmatique, tentons, analysons la réaction de notre environnement d'ingénieur sur nos réflexions. 
Je suis sûrement loin de votre niveau d'expression et de connaissance de nos sujets mais me lance quand même pour un post linked, informel, discutable mais qui veut mettre le pied dans la porte à ouvrir en 2023 pour une exploration bien plus approfondie. 
Je vous partage le brouillon ci-dessous qui est une initiative complètement personnelle, que je publierai et assumerai comme telle, surtout si certaines ne vous conviennent pas. D'ailleurs, n'hésitez pas à m'en faire part. Peut-etre que cela pourra ouvrir des débats.

**"Dancing by Systems", Donna Meadows**

In my projects, I like playing with analogies, heuristics like the famous "eye is a good architect", from Maier and Rechtin in *The Art of Systems Architecting*. It complements models, enriches the communication, federates architects and engineers.

During COVID period, I co-published for INCOSE Insight magazine a paper about the architecture of organisation has similarities with driving orchestra, in concordance with the style of the music, illustrated with two extreme examples, Jazz, Classical Symphony. The intention was to illustrate the need of integrating  the organization with the entity of interest during the architecture project. 
But what about a method to decide for a right balance?

2022 reopened the opportunities of physical collaboration and I had the chance to meet extraordinary people, all sharing beliefs on the power of systems thinking, the importance of Architecture, witnessing the gap between a scientific socle and its application in our modern, occidental organisations.

During a last enthousiastic discussion, somebody pointed the fabulous text from Donna Meadows, "Dancing with systems".

In her text, Donna Meadow, following the second wave of cybernetic principle, encourages the systems thinker to perceive the system and its environment, in a constructivist approach, accept parts cannot be perceived, but also to act, as a pragmatic, with the system in an artistic way that has many similarities to dance.
It is so rich, so inspiring.

Dance is associated to art, beauty, good, human things.
Donna Meadows often refers to ethic. It is obvious architect shall be ethical too. Its conception will impact the system and its environment for the lifetime of the system and presumably later. 

This concern reminds me the importance of the ethic of Paul Cilliers, critical system thinker. In continuation to the post-structuralism, he also, assumes it is a waste of time to try to anticipate what cannot be perceived but proposes some other directions, considering complexity cannot be handled as a whole but with strategies, practices and critical selection of methodologies.

All of those leads us far from the architecture I have experience but I'm convinced integrating new methods will considerably improve the quality of my daily work.

Maybe it is time for systems architecture to develop a critical approach of the discipline.

Thank you Sandrine, Pierre Olivier, jean-Luc , Louisette, Emmanuel, Emeric
