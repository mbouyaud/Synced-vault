Architecture : Cf. definition of the 45.000


Methodology : 
- Prescriptive / descriptive
	- 15288 / INCOSE SE HBK Systems Engineering locates architecture as part of its process
		- Architecture is a priori framed by views to be addressed
		- It corrupts the activity of architecting with limited semantic language. 
		- Skipping the need addressing real concerns of the complexity.
	- Business architecture framework
		- works on capabilities.
		- Patterns
		- but limited to organization
- All are comtemplative. Make a boundary between the architect and the entity of interest.
- Need for a pragmatic approach
	- like it is really applied in IT architecture. But finally, architects become expert. Running after the technical evolution. Not really understanding the integration of those technology into organization. 
	- Focused on the systems.
	- Letting the organisation architecture to managements and their management theory.
