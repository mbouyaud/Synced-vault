"Adopting a post-structural perspective on science will certainly be in conflict with much of what is accepted as canonical theory of science, but may have less radical effects on the practice of science than one expects. Unless one would want to call the opening up of new spaces for creative thought something radical (page 52)."

"Cilliers framed his understanding of complexity not in terms of a fully-fledged ‘theory of complexity’, but by highlighting what consequences a complex systems approach has for re-thinking our research and decision-making practices. Adopt- ing an ‘attitude of complexity’"

# Le cerveau comme une unité fonctionnelle relationnelle 

- Knowledge is not represented locally in an iconic fashion (as is the case in conventional computers and rule-based systems), but is rather distributed over the whole system. This is because knowledge is a function of the connec- tion strength between units.
	
- If brain functioning is purely relational, the system cannot be rule-based on a first level, because there are only interactions (traces).
- 
Given his description of how neural networks are structured and function, Cil- liers argues that the connectionist model poses a more general model of com- plexity than traditional rule-based models. Moreover, Cilliers argues that the connectionist model of the brain shows a strong correlation with the structural and post-structural models of language. In these models, meaning is constituted relationally, which implies that there is ‘no distinction between levels, no overar-

ching algorithm, but everything [should be understood] in terms of relations [...] not between positive entities, but always only relations of relations’

# La complexité est dans la relation entre les entités

There is nothing mystical about the workings of a complex system. However, since the nature of the system is the result of countless, local, nonlinear, non-algorithmic, dynamic interaction, it cannot be described completely and accurately in terms of a set of rules

Cilliers argues that ‘to fully understand a complex system, we need to under- stand it in all its complexity’ (page 143). Considering that complex systems are characterised as open systems that interact with their environment in a dynamic and nonlinear manner, modelling complexity in all its complexity would imply that one would have to ‘understand the system’s complete environment before we can understand the system, and, of course, the environment is complex in itself’ (page 143). As a consequence of this ‘incompressibility’ that charac- terises complex phenomena, Cilliers purports that there can be no perfect rep- resentation of the system that is simpler than the system itself.

	[t]here is a certain economy involved in the process whereby differences generate meaning in a complex system.’ Boundaries also imply that complex systems have a certain knowable identity, which – although malleable – can be repeated over time, meaning that complex systems also have a recognisable and repeatable identity
