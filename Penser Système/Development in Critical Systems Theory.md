4 Courant Onto-epistemiological paradigmatic

 - Hard systems -> Operations Research and System Dynamics  ‘positiv- ist/structural
 - soft’ systems -> such as Soft Systems Methodology and Interactive Management ‘interpretivist’ paradigm
 - Critical Systems Thinking ->  ‘critical-emancipatory’ paradigm. 
 - ‘postmodern-poststructuralist’ paradigm as a theo- retical home of yet another sort.


# positivist/structural-functionalist systems paradigm
the world of modern science and social science: the world of certainty; of logical proofs and deductions, reproducibly verifiable facts and hypotheses, exact measurements, objective observation, of unbiased and universal truths.

Barnard’s Systems Theory, Contingency Theory, Socio-Technical Systems Theory, Beer’s Viable Systems Model (VSM), Organizational Cybernetics, Operational Research (OR), Systems Analysis, Systems Engineering, System Dynamics, Senge’s Fifth Discipline, Miller’s Living Systems Theory, Tracy’s Living Organization, Autopoiesis and Complexity Theory (Jackson, 2000; Bowers, 2011).

# interpretivist systems paradigm
So-called ‘soft’ problems tend to be broad, volatile and ambiguous (ibid.).

# postmodernist-poststructuralist systems paradigm
the true nature of the world thwarts our at- tempts to ‘know’ it. The world we do ‘know’ and the values we hold are socially constructed, it says, and they are relative. Reliant upon our human-languaged constructions, ignorances and biases are unavoidable and we must reflexively question the very bases of our assump- tions. This paradigm exposes us to our limitations and can and should engender transparency, humility and open-mindedness

[Post structuralism](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralisme) !!!

Rather than seeing systems as bounded physical entities, Churchman realized that a system is bounded conceptually by the researcher as s/he chooses what to include and exclude in observation and analysis. All knowledge is depend- ent on boundary judgments, whether these are implicit or explicit (Church- man, 1970; Ulrich, 1983). If we recognize this, then both knowledge generat- ing systems [e.g., the systemist] and the world itself come to be defined in ex- actly the same manner [my emphasis]: through the process of making bound- ary judgments.
