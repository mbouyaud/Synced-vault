natural thinking is to think taking into account the natural systems
- Taking the most of information and analysis.

## Praxis limitation
70's Praxis : you reproduce what you exerperience and you practice it
Heuristics: 
		- You see what you are looking for
		- Cognitive bias or energy reduction on what you are looking for.

You satisfy but you don't optimize.

We evolve to take decision with a limited dataset

Conservative management : you take limited dataset and you map to what you know.

## complexity science

you realize you unknown in the systems
come from physic, moved to biology then to social.

It evolves with history (before Newton)
It is a question of competency

It is a question of dispositionality (statefull) but not causality.
-> need of fast feedback.
-> Weak signals of patterns.

Large number of agents.
-> means you don't see the system holistically.
-> scenarios are limites by people limitation to imagine the system

**Consequence : you need to work with raw data**.
-> otherwise your data are filtered by people limitation and cognitive bias.
-> when talking to direct stakeholder : need to live with uncertainty of stories of those stakeholders.

## cynefin framework

When you want Cynefin

-> 3 types of systems
Ordered systems : everything is ruled, ordered, so is predictable (solid)
	- Complicated is ordered.
Chaotic : (gaz) (sociology) a system without effective constraints.
Complex adaptive system : not defined by perimeter but by relations (liquid)

Transition to a state to an other is 
- a question of energy
- of constraints

Le point des 3 Ã©tats and you don't know where you will go.
- aporetic domain.
- A question 
	- you know the answer is process. 
	- you don't know the answer is problem. Aporetic.
- See things from different way

## Management

You don't have one approach of management
- till now, there is a chain of new process that are systematically applied everywhere.
- but a manufacturer is different than IT

ordered approach : linear objectives. Compare the result with the objective. enrich the dataset with the result
Complex approach : 
- value flexible boundaries
- Catalystic approach : manage the emergence with beneficial coherence inside a boundary. 
	- example for the kid party:  you propose a barbecue
	- example in the paper of the EU for managing crisis.

## decision 

Depending on the system type
Adductive : There is a many to many relationship between the past and the futrure : most are repetition. 
- exception : mutability
- Adaptive logic

Abductive : comes from the pragmatic science
- hypotheseis generation
- association
- exaptation : look for the utility (e.g. microeven discovery)
