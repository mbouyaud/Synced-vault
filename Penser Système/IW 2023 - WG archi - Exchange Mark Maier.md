You wrote about the art of systems architecting, Donna Meadows wrote about dancing with Systems. Can it be a changing paradigm for a less analytical systems engineering?

To me it is a matter of perspective. In day-to-day work I spend a lot of time on the science part. But design is a mix. Fully comprehending big problems requires a system perspective that will never grasp the whole thing. For some system problems thinking you really can control/design the thing is a big fiction. I rather like the "dancing" idea for how one should think about working with systems at say the scale of the environment where control is crazy to believe.!
