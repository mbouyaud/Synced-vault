# Guidelines
What I need from you:  Please review the author guidelines, approach and timeline below, along with any comments tagged to your title, and confirm your commitment to be an author before or at this Thursday's monthly meeting.  If  you are part of a multi-author paper, please confirm the primary author, i.e., a point of contact for me and Art.  and will let you know if we need to take you up on your offer to do the  

  

## Author Guidelines  
  *  Nominally 2000 words. Can be a little longer (but no "books"); shouldn't be too short (500 words is too short)  

  *  It's free format with an overview (or intro), section topics, then citations, primary references and secondary (additional) references.  
    *  it's about giving readers the essence of the topic and then showing them where to get more info  
    * so basically frame the topic; substantiate with refs, tables, figures (and consumable prose); list the sources  
    *  Look at a few existing articles to see the pattern  

Approach & Timeline for Oct 2023 SEBOK update  
*  Approach: iterative, with Art as primary reviewer.  
*  Timeline  
    *  June:  Abstract/Intro and review by Art.  
    *  July/August:  Iterations  (one or two depending on article length and complexity, as well as Art's comments)  
    *  September: Final version  
 *  Format:  Word through final version. Then they convert to the SEBOK platform


# Paper - PSS Systems engineering and software services products  

[article](/Users/mbouyaud/Documents/perso/INCOSE/SW&SI/SEBOK 2023/INSIGHT_v24-2_0721.pdf)



SysE in Software Svc Prod (pub #5c)  Augment with insights from Business Relevance stories, multisided markets  

Mickael, Macaulay, Jeannine (for ebook extracts)


# Abstract preparation


Feedback : 
- A short paragraph with a few of the key points, focused on Service Products,  and an outline will be needed.
- merger of what  you have below with what was in the abstract of the original paper (but removing the Unicorn project reference and adding in a general comment about this arena instead).    i.e.,  what is a service product, that there are still shortfalls in the software dev for these kinds of products/orgs, and systems engineering can be applied to both org and product in particular ways to address (what) gaps. Also that it is situational, hence the 2 analogies.   Then list what the sections will be (also removing the Unicorn project references).
- One of those stories is ecommerce, and it got me thinking that some commentary (using your original scenarios and the ecommerce scenario) about multi-sided markets  and products (service products in particular) needing to work in ecosystems  would be useful for further broadening everyone's perspective on ways to apply systems engineering/thinking.  i.e., the product itself, the org, the ecosystem.






Gaps : 
- Models of Information flow  -> Jeannine
	- between PS buildling blocks
	- interaction between delivery team and produced system
- Organisation topology -> John Wood
