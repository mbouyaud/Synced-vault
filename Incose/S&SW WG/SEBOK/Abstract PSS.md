The software industry has been experiencing several transformations. Development teams now often autonomously deliver business capabilities to software service systems.
With the development of new methodologies deployed in SW organisations, new Software technologies, Systems Engineering discipline brings value for engineering the organization and its products. 
This article uses a model Product Service Systems (PSS), an approach for modeling  both organisation and SW products, developed by AFIS French INCOSE chapter. A PSS is a socio-technical system that comprises a system of interest, a system of support and a system of operations.
Another model developed in PSS is the Service Building Block as a unit in an organisation in charge of delivering a business capability. Model integrates people, means, governance and interface. An organization is then a compositions of SBB.
Then two organization patterns are explored top down management (orchestra model) and agile (jazz band). The first one is very common in hierarchical organisation industries already deploying Systems Engineering. The whole is mastered in a pyramidal way and optimizes rationalisation of efforts and costs. The second is common in SW industry deploying agile based methodologies and frameworks. It guarantees autonomy of the teams and the business product. SBB permits an analysis of performances and search for optimal with an hybrid of both.
For this analysis, Systems Engineering is appropriate because it encompasses every element of the socio-technical system composing the organization and the produced service system
"A story from eCommerce"  in the eBook developed by S&SWI WG is an illustration of advantages of Systems Engineering on both organization and produced system to optimize collaboration, avoid silos, rationalise efforts in a long term perspective.
