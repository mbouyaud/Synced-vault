# Intro

Various heterogenous software technologies carry services produced by software-intensive organizations. Multiple product-service system components require respective skills, tools, and infrastructures. The software service industry usually requires fast actions to react to business demands and continual improvement activities extending product services. When usage makes up the demand signal, it can quickly evolve, shortening software development cycles and improving the delivery process. Our attention should be on the integration and delivery process quality and fluidity to make them continuous. Standard tools deploy to merge, test, and deliver freshly developed updates into the other software artefacts. As an example, Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD) is a deployed methodology to constantly brings value to the product and avoid interruption in the delivery process.
This is made feasible by a large application of automation brought by recent software technologies and tools.
The resulted autonomy of the team is a real gain to manage the needed adaptation to the product in reaction to its integration and acceptation in the environment.
The negative consequence is the loss of understanding the system on the one hand and the redundancy of functions, effort, development in the organisation on the other hand.
Systems Engineering dealing with Socio-Technical systems is greatly placed to manage those challenges.

A service-system is a socio-technical system that comprises:  

- A System of Interest (typically, a technological product expected to provide some type of service by satisfying specified performance, behavioral and operational needs);  
    
- A System of Support that enhances the operational capabilities of the system of interest (e.g. equipment and systems delivered under availability or output-based commitments);  
    
- A System of Operation that enhances operational capabilities to achieve overall operational performance for the customers and contributes to the success of their core mission (e.g. education, training, supply chain management, fleet management, mission preparation).

## Building block description

This SBB interacts and exchanges information or services with other service building blocks, products, or consumers. Each SBB brings its capacities to the wider system, the organi- zation. A search for operation optimization can improve global performance (operating cost, selling price, and service continuity).

This model includes people, means,  
and implicit or explicit governance in the service producer system. It has reaction, autonomy, and self-adaptation capacities. This adaptability permits configuration, function, performance, and need modifica- tions in long- or short-term objectives.

A team in an organization is a service system building block. We can classify teams and companies as complex systems (White 2015). They have characteristics  
of ambiguity, unpredictability, evolution, emergence, instability, collaboration, diver- sity, adaptability, and more.

Various heterogenous software technologies carry services produced by software-intensive organizations. Multiple product-service system components require respective skills, tools, and infrastructures. 

A good example of implementation of Service Systems is IT industry. It usually requires fast actions to react to business demands and continual improvement activities extending product services. When usage makes up the demand signal, it can quickly evolve, shortening software devel-opment cycles and improving the delivery process. Our attention should be on the integration and delivery process quality and fluidity to make them continuous. Standard tools deploy to merge, test, and deliver freshly developed updates into the other software artefacts in a Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery process.

Diagrams above illustrate the coupling between teams, governance, and system integration, verification and validation in an IT context. Software infrastructure automates all the processes from building, code transforma- tion, and libraries into program artifacts to run—a term for executing applications in a production context. 

SBB compositions analyze relations be- tween organization components. Applying the SBB helps manage growth, identify potential mean factorization, and find the correct balance between service blocks

to deliver a better product service. This system model is a decision tool when some consistency problems arise concerning the company strategy.

# Different types of service organization
PSS model allows the analysis of different organization types that are relevant and commonly deployed in SW organizations.

## Pyramidal organization 

In monolith organisation, organized with a many-tiered pyrami- dal hierarchy, basic software pro- grams manage employee services, salaries, documentation, and stock management. Projects are simple and follow classical V-cycle processes. Software teams organize by activities, development, integration, test, delivery, and production with each aspect linked in the chain.  
This organization type rations resources and tries to optimize each process by gath- ering and harmonizing competencies and tools in the same place, akin to Figure 2. Management attempts firm control and unidirectional interactions and typically operates beyond the other teams. Central management decides tactical orders and relays them through layers much like an orchestra.  
Only management and the product itself contact the environment. Each team plays a partition and follows the conductor’s lead. Project execution follows a linear and rigid process and imposes a strong coupling between activities for bringing a new capa- bility into the system. This chain will break if any link fails. The lacking autonomy requires the team leader to apply corrective actions directly.

The whole organization can be modelled as a big Service Building Block.


## DevOps organizations
With a product owner and DevOps, teams have new environmental interfaces to interact with customers and directly use the appropriate service operation infra- structure. The producing team performs the qualification process during an actual case demo—an agile term for the ceremo- nial process of testing a delivered capabil- ity as an end-user could do. This process efficiently discovers lacking capabilities and

bugs and encourages the higher perfor- mance of the developers, who behave more as engineers than as technicians like in the previous story period. Outside managers drive teams less, and inside leaders, who help develop quality reference code, push more.

Software infrastructure automates all the processes from building, code transforma- tion, and libraries into program artifacts to run—a term for executing applications in a production context. The Figure 3 infra- structure domain illustrates tools listed in The Unicorn Project by their iconic logos. These tools compose the infrastructure and technology stack. The framework and tool landscape is vast and evolves fast. Since Kim wrote the book, some tools are already obsolete. Software engineers use their various communities to follow the trends. Maxine, The Unicorn Project hero, spends time on social networks to exchange with experts.

The DevOps individual masters both the delivery flow and the company’s infrastruc- ture stack, making the business applications run without any supplementary actions. Systems engineers must know what capabil- ity to offer the producing team; how it can improve development, integration, testing, and running processes; and the needed supplemental operations, resources, and operation monitoring.

The subsystems composing the end-to-end service system are delivered by independent teams providing uncoupled unitary service and creating the final product service system, as several service building blocks create a product service. Each service building block can adapt to the environment and, therefore, to the business needs.
