Developing an architecture is: “Framing the opportunity, shaping the future”.

We may have to develop an architecture in a context that is itself evolving,

which must therefore fit into a future environment: this environment can be known, uncertain or unknown.

The position of the architect: as a designer of the future (the system in its context) must face uncertainty and consider methods to address the unknown and master uncertainties.

 Uncertainty takes place in a known domain of knowledge: if an element of context is characterized as being certain or uncertain, this means that it is known, by facts or evidence showing its possible manifestation.

 Uncertainty refers to a measurement, evaluation, decision. It applies to known things that have a part of unknown.

The unknown refers to something that is not perceived. It leads to uncertainty on a higher level issue.

Example, many unknowns make our future uncertain. Uncertainty is therefore perceptible and modelable. The unknown is not.

From an engineering point of view, uncertainty and its impact can be analyzed and taken into account. The unknown will require other methods (other engineering, experiments, etc.). Uncertainty can be studied, controlled, evolve during the life cycle of the system. The unknown, by chain of causes, can appear during the life cycle of the system. The unknown is to be taken into account in all areas but especially in those that face adversity.

Our time has been giving illustrations that our world has much surprises for us. We have learnt to be humble in from of uncertainties and unknowns. Managing knowledge and dealing with the non-knowledge is part of systems engineering. Managing unknowns is fundamental for engineering systems facing adversity and competition.
Rumsfeld dichotomy can help to classify the approaches. Known knowns are the foundations of requirements and needs analysis. Known unknowns are usually treated as uncertainty. Systems Engineers are limiting their impacts. Dealing with unknown knowns is managing risk. It is a whole part of the S.E. discipline.
Unknown unknowns, with emergences "appearing" at any time of the system lifecycle,  require adaptation of the posture as for examples
- Adopt additional methodologies in activities and processes based on soft or combination of soft and hard  systems thinking (ref M.C. Jackson or Cynefin framework)
- Monitor emergences of patterns and phenomena, align impacts with stakeholders and define remediations actions (Correction, Adaptation, Transformation, Failure) following OODA Loop concepts (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) and its derivatives.
- Influence unknown entities with Act-Sense-Adapt loop
- Develop Scenario planning involves creating and analyzing multiple plausible future scenarios to anticipate potential outcomes and make informed decisions.

System is the entity of interest for systems engineers and developing knowledge about it is the objective. But context (or environment) is also important for engineering a good system in its operational contexts.
- "Known context" are by nature evolutive but these evolutions are precisely known and characterized. The stakes are to build future architecture increments.
- "Uncertain context": evolutive and these evolutions may be foreseen through prospective effort, but no certainty on which evolution will come into reality (probabilities). The stakes are to make relevant projections on the future, and master all along the system lifecycle the gap between reality and the project assumptions.
- "Unknown context": evolutive in a way that cannot be or has not been foreseen. The stakes are to have the Capability at Project/Enterprise level to manage the new situation impact on the project (or get opportunities from the new situation).
The task will be to control uncertainties and manage unknowns by
- Qualifying systems against out of expected range interaction of the context
- Exploring possible futures scenarios based on FOE « future Operating Environnement ,  Sci. Fi. Methodology. Cf. Red Team books developed by french defense. [link](https://redteamdefense.org/saison-1/red-team-defense-saison-1)
- Developing uncertainty perspectives with appropriate languages in architecture frameworks
