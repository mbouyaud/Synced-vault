anthropocene : 
- conserve the capabilities (used and potential)

Notion of anthropocentered levels : give examples
- system -> durabilty
- person -> personnal growth, interest
- group -> interpersonnal
- organisation 
- environment -> regulation CSR, organization (ADEME, U.N.) 
- earth : maree, tectonique movement 

Idea: introduce a graph with boundaried that illustrate thé notion of level change

But each level creates something to the other level like in chemistry.
- notion of émergence. Link to emergentist.
Idea : complète thé diagram with emerging properties at upper level. New colour


Come back to the n-1 level. And address sustainability and responsibility like chemist address energy, température changes, ...

Then :

Sustainability and durability
- growth costs -> theory of Meadow
- any action has other impacts. Any growth and decrease have starve or let place to another system. (Rene Thom -> Moebius ring)

What IS thé leveraging point for sustainability. 
Since it is at thé conscients level, following thé knowledge stair model, it shall bé addressed AT thé knowledge and information level 
With strength (requirement) coming from thé upper layer
