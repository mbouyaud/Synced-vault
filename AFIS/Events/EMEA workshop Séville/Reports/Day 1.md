## Intro 

Presentation H. Stower - Specialist americain des fusées et du DoD.

Technical -> but a big movement is the change of boundaries between technical systems and humans which push us to talk about socio technical systems.
There are some sections about Human systems integration 
But we all know about the acceptation, the trust. This cannot be managed by an analytical and paradimatical approach.
So my question : is systems engineering ready to integrate  new methodology based on social science, systems thinking like critical sytems thinking. 
Or will we still talk about 2 disciplines?

--> answer is now. We stay on the technical and technological aspects.

Another remark. our world is all about information sharing, controling, exchanging. Why this domain 


# Systems Science

-> c'est toujours tres structuralistes
-> on part d'une vérité de départ.
