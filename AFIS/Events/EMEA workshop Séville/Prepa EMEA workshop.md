# Session architecture

sustainability and durability in SE (dimensions, concepts, epistemology…)
[[Dimensions of sustainability and durability]]


Sustainability epistemology
- emergence
- recurcivity

back to the basis
- Prendre le debut du texte de [chongquiin analysis](/Users/mbouyaud/Documents/perso/INCOSE/Prepa EMEA WSEC/Prepa ma session/Chongquin analysis.pdf)
- Peut etre y mettre du "segura river"
- proposition reprendre la revue du guide et mon commentaire sur la qualité : avoir une
	- Typically, quality goes thru three set of states: 
		- a) during the design/architecture phase when the desired qualities that should be present in the entity of interest, 
		- b) during the engineering/implementation phase when the identified qualities are imbibed into the entity of interest, 
		- c) during the experiencing/using phase when customers experience the quality of the entity of interest in real-time situations
		- Rajouter d) during the retired phase. The quality of the entity to not have debt onto the environment

Thème : 
- Synergy in the systemic approach to architectural performance: The integral multi-and cross-layered agencies in eco-systemic generative design processes of the post-anthropocene.
- the leveraging point : from Donna Meadows https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/

(in increasing order of effectiveness)

12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).  
11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.  
10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).  
9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.  
8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.  
7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.  
6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).  
5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).  
4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.  
3. The goals of the system.  
2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.  
1. The power to transcend paradigms.

"system is more, less, different than the sum of its parts. (...)
The idea of emergence can not be separated from systemic morphogenetic, i.e. the creation of a new form which defines a whole : the complex and organised unity. It is about morphogenetic, because the system is a reality topologically, qualitatively, new in space and time.
Emergences are global and particular properties, issues from this "formation" and not separable from the transformation of the elements. The gains and  losses demontrate that the elements which participate to a systems are transformed and starting from a whole. So we are coming to a key systemic principle : the link between formation and transformation. Everything wich forms transforms."
